# OpenVote Architecture

## Overview

OpenVote is built on a decentralized architecture that leverages blockchain technology for secure and transparent voting. The system consists of three main components:

1. Smart Contracts
2. Frontend Application
3. Backend Services (Optional)

## Smart Contracts

The core of OpenVote is implemented as Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. The main contract (`Voting.sol`) handles:

- Candidate management
- Vote casting
- Vote counting
- Access control
- Event emission for transparency

### Key Features

- **Ownership**: Contract ownership for administrative functions
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrancy attacks
- **Event Logging**: All important actions are logged as events
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can perform specific actions

## Frontend Application

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, providing a user-friendly interface for:

- Wallet connection
- Viewing candidates
- Casting votes
- Viewing results

### Key Components

- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask support for Ethereum transactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Event listeners for blockchain updates
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Security Considerations

1. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Access control
   - Input validation
   - Gas optimization

2. **Frontend Security**
   - Input sanitization
   - Secure wallet connection
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting

3. **General Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Code reviews
   - Testing coverage
   - Documentation

## Deployment Architecture

```

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   - Hardhat for local blockchain
   - React development server
   - MetaMask local network

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for smart contracts
   - Integration tests
   - Frontend component tests

3. **Deployment**
   - Smart contract deployment scripts
   - Frontend build and deployment
   - Network configuration

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Layer 2 solutions
   - Gas optimization
   - Caching strategies

2. **Features**
   - Multiple election types
   - Advanced voting mechanisms
   - Analytics dashboard

3. **Integration**
   - Additional wallet support
   - Cross-chain compatibility
   - API integrations
